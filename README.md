# Perfect maze generator

This project is an implementation of the Depth-first algorithm for maze generation.
It is provided as a Python 3 module, with a Maze class.

## Contents of Maze module :

- Choose the width and length when instanciating the Maze class
- Generate a random maze with generate() method
- Draw it in ascii symbols with draw()
- I also provide an example of use with maze_generator.py

## Further improvements ideas

- Let the user provide its own drawing methods, more flexible architecture
- Graphical version
- I'm opened to sugestions
